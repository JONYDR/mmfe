# MEGAMIX -F Edition-
This page will be used for releases/updates for Project DIVA MEGAMIX -F Edition-. This mod is about having AFT/FT and MEGA39s songs ported into Project DIVA F! It will have new modules (edited too, so they can fit PDF style), actual redesigned charts with technical zones, and chance time events for all songs, unfortunately there will not be long notes, since the only way to add them is writing them manually almost, because they can be added with a converter (converting slides to long notes), but they gets out of sync... There will be new menu graphics, new sprites, you will be able to use DIVA ROOM, EDIT MODE, using brand new modules!

It will be available on PS3/RPCS3 and PS VITA!

We have been working on this mod since november of 2019.
